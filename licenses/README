The dpdk-fpr uses the Open Source BSD-3-Clause license for the core libraries and
drivers.

Including big blocks of License headers in all files blows up the
source code with mostly redundant information.  An additional problem
is that even the same licenses are referred to by a number of
slightly varying text blocks (full, abbreviated, different
indentation, line wrapping and/or white space, with obsolete address
information, ...) which makes validation and automatic processing a nightmare.

To make this easier, dpdk-fpr uses a single line reference to Unique License
Identifiers in source files as defined by the Linux Foundation's SPDX project
(https://spdx.org/).

Adding license information in this fashion, rather than adding full license
text, can be more efficient for developers; decreases errors; and improves
automated detection of licenses. The current set of valid, predefined SPDX
identifiers is set forth on the SPDX License List at https://spdx.org/licenses/.

dpdk-fpr uses first line of the file to be SPDX tag. In case of *#!* scripts, SPDX
tag can be placed in 2nd line of the file.

For example, to label a file as subject to the BSD-3-Clause license,
the following text would be used:

SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

Any new file contributions in dpdk-fpr shall adhere to the above scheme.
It is also being recommended to replace the existing license text in the code
with SPDX-License-Identifiers.

dpdk-fpr project supported licenses are:

1. BSD 3-clause "New" or "Revised" License
	SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
	URL: http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause#licenseText
	License text: licenses/bsd-3-clause.txt
